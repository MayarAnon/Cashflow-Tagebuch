üí∞ Cashflow Tagebuch

A simple yet effective web application for managing your personal finances, built with HTML, CSS, and pure JavaScript. It allows you to track income and expenses, set savings goals, manage fixed costs, and analyze your financial progress with interactive charts. The entire application runs client-side, meaning your data is stored securely in your browser's local storage and never touches a server.

üöÄ Features

    Track Transactions: Add income and expenses with details such as amount, category, account, and description.

    Manage Accounts: Create and manage different accounts (e.g., checking account, savings account, cash) for a better overview.

    Customize Categories: Define your own categories for income and expenses to structure your finances more accurately.

    Set Savings Goals: Set financial targets and track your progress toward them.

    Keep an Eye on Fixed Costs: Record recurring expenses and add them as transactions quickly when needed.

    Dynamic Overview: View real-time statistics and visualize your finances with interactive charts (pie and bar charts).

    Data Management: Export your data as a JSON file and import it back when needed for backups.

    Fully Offline Capable: Since no server-side logic is required, the app can be used completely offline.

üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack

    HTML: For the structure and layout of the user interface.

    CSS: For the modern, dark theme and responsive design.

    JavaScript: The entire functionality, from adding transactions to generating charts, is implemented in pure JavaScript.

    Chart.js: A powerful JavaScript library used to create the charts in the financial overview.
